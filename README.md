# WiiLink WFC Patcher
WiiLink Wi-Fi Connection aims to be an open source server replacement for Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
This repository includes the client side patches necessary for connecting to WWFC.

The repository is split into the following directories:

* [patch](patch) - The initial 'stage 0' patch made to the game to connect to WWFC.
* [stage1](stage1) - The non-game-specific stage 1 payload downloaded by the initial patch.
* [payload](payload) - The final stage 2 payload downloaded and verified by stage 1. This is a game-specific payload
that makes patches to the running game, including important security patches and general improvements to the game's code.

Each directory includes its own README file with more detailed information on the section.

Working with Python 3.10. Use make.sh -all to generate all content.
This fork has been setup to only generate MKWii patches.
